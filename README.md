# begining-tube

Extension that automatically sets start time of any YouTube video to 0:00. This is mostly useful when listening to music via YouTube, give youtube likes to sometimes start songs in time you left them off rather than at the beginning.

**Work in progress** this extension is more annoying now than useful.
